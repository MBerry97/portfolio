        I discovered my love for code during my stint as a Recruitment
        Consultant. I started to learn the basics of HTML and CSS to understand
        and fully interact with developers, from there I realised this was the
        career for me and enrolled on a 3 month JavaScript journey with
        NorthCoders. At NorthCoders I have covered the fundementals of
        JavaScript, built and back end API, a front-end webpage and a project
        which can be found here.
