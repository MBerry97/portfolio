        I discovered my a passion for coding during my stint as a Recruitment
        Consultant. I started to learn HTML and CSS to gain a better
        understanding of the bascis of Front End Development. A few weeks later
        I enroll at NorthCoders, in which I have built a back end API, a
        front-end webpage and a project which can be found here.
